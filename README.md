# 🛠️ Complaint Management System (Python CLI)

This is a command-line-based Complaint Management System built in Python. It allows users to:

- Submit a new complaint
- View all recorded complaints
- Search for a specific complaint by ID
- Mark complaints as resolved

All complaint data is stored in a local text file (`complaints.txt`), making it simple and lightweight for local use or educational purposes.
